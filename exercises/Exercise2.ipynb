In the following exercises/examples we will investigate the behaviour of a multi-qubit circuit comprised of a Hadamard and C-NOT gate and how it can be used in conjunction with another simple gate to obtain each of the four maximally entangled states known as the Bell states. These states form the minimally spanning, orthonormal basis set of the four-dimensional Hilbert space of two qubits.\n",
